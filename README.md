Repository for AspireNex Internship on Artificial Intelligence.

Hi guys!

My name is Aakash Praveen of Muthoot Institute of Technology and Science, Kochi, Kerala

The two tasks i have chosen for the Artificial Intelligence Internship is 
+ CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES
+ FACE DETECTION AND RECOGNITION


CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES


The chatbot is implemented along with a restaurant website. The chatbot called MOMO is used to improve the customer experience of the restaurant. 

This chatbot is developed with the help of watsonx Assistant which was developed by myself as part of the IBM Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals Internship course.

The chatbot is developed based on basic if-else conditions and is very user friendly and interactive.

The website is also functional (payment functionality not added).

To access the website please select index2.html from the CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES folder.

The video demo of the working of the chatbot has been provided in the CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES folder.
